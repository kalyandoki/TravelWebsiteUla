        <br />
        <p>
          2014 - Founded by K. Chandrashekar, our journey began in a cozy café
          in Bangalore, where a passion for nature and adventure sparked the
          creation of our proprietary firm. We initially catered to 100 nature
          enthusiasts, designing customized itineraries that took them to some
          of the most stunning parks in India and Africa. This humble beginning
          ignited a vision to connect travelers with the wonders of the natural
          world, setting the stage for the transformative experiences we offer
          today.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2015-2016 - Thanks to the enthusiastic word-of-mouth referrals from
          our guests, we evolved from a small venture into a Private Limited
          company, now proudly serving over 1,000 plus travellers and their
          families. Our expansive offerings include leisure and wilderness
          holidays across India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East,
          allowing us to create unforgettable experiences for adventurers of all
          kinds.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2017- 2018 - We expanded our reach to manage large corporate events in
          offbeat destinations, successfully catering to corporate groups
          ranging from 100 to 150 attendees per event. Our team grew from just 4
          to 10 dedicated professionals, allowing us to enhance our offerings
          for families seeking leisure holidays around the globe. Alongside this
          growth, we remained committed to serving nature enthusiasts and
          wildlife photographers, crafting customized, bespoke journeys that
          immerse them in the beauty of the wild.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2018 - 2020 - We successfully organized large corporate events in
          offbeat destinations, accommodating groups ranging from 150 to 400
          participants. Our wildlife journeys to Africa have seen remarkable
          growth, starting with just 19 guests and reaching an impressive 125
          during the wildebeest migration season alone. Each year, we proudly
          serve over 500 guests exploring nature parks across India and beyond.
          Our leisure holiday offerings have also expanded significantly,
          establishing us as one of the top travel consultants for Kerala and
          Himachal tourism. With our experienced team now enthusiastically
          catering to destinations like the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bali, and the
          Andaman Islands, we continue to create unforgettable experiences for
          travelers around the world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2020 - 2021 - During the challenging times of the pandemic, we united
          to support our community. As pioneers, we launched a web series
          featuring renowned wildlife photographers and media personalities,
          sharing their insights with our guests. All proceeds from these events
          were donated to forest guards and their families in need, exemplifying
          our commitment to those who protect our natural world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We also conducted a very successful Wildlife photography competition
          called `RIGHT XPOSURE` with International judges. We had Discovery
          channel and Sanctuary Asia as our lead sponsors and mentors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2023 - 2024 - In the aftermath of the pandemic, while many travel
          companies faced closure, we emerged stronger than ever. Although some
          of our team members returned to their hometowns, we renewed our
          commitment to excellence and quickly adapted to the changing
          landscape. 2024 has been one of our most successful years,
          particularly in our Africa business, as our leisure travel offerings
          have rebounded impressively. With our delighted customers returning
          and operations back on track, we are excited about the future and
          ready to create even more unforgettable experiences.
